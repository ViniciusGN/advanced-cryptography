# Advanced Cryptography Practical Projects
Vinicius Nascimento <br>

This repository will host a series of practical labs for **Advanced Cryptography** (ENSICAEN ‚Äî 3A Informatique, CyIA, 2025). Each lab focuses on a specific cryptographic building block or algorithm.

### 1. Finite Fields & Groups (Lab 1)

**Folder name:** `01. Finite-fields-and-groups`

**Objective:**  
Implement core algebraic primitives used in cryptography: group operations over **‚Ñ§p** (additive/multiplicative) and **ùîΩ‚ÇÇ‚Åø**, a generic **Montgomery Ladder** exponentiation, **Diffie‚ÄìHellman** checks, and **Discrete Logarithm** solvers (trial multiplication and **Baby-Step Giant-Step**).

**Key Features:**
- Unified group interface (`Group`, `SubGroup`) with a single `law`:
  - ‚Ñ§p (additive): `(a + b) mod p`, identity `0`
  - (‚Ñ§p)√ó (multiplicative): `(a * b) mod p`, identity `1`
  - ùîΩ‚ÇÇ‚Åø (multiplicative): Russian-style multiply with reduction by the irreducible polynomial (`poly`), identity `1`
- Generic **exp** via Montgomery Ladder (works across all supported groups; handles negative exponents mod N)
- **Diffie‚ÄìHellman**: randomized check and deterministic validator
- **DLP**: `DLbyTrialMultiplication`, `DLbyBabyStepGiantStep`, and `ComputeDL(œÑ)` dispatcher

**How to Run:**  
Inside the lab folder:
```bash
cd lab1-finite-fields-and-groups
python3 tests.py
```

The script runs all verifications in the assignment‚Äôs order (Parts 1 to 5).

**Files:**
- `classes.py` ‚Äî class implementations
- `tests.py` ‚Äî ordered checks and prints
- `lab1_utils.py` ‚Äî provided helper (no changes required)

## Summary

This project covers foundational cryptography topics:

- **Algebraic Structures:** groups over ‚Ñ§p and fields ùîΩ‚ÇÇ‚Åø  
- **Exponentiation:** Montgomery Ladder (constant-shape)  
- **Key Exchange:** Diffie‚ÄìHellman property validation  
- **Hard Problems:** Discrete Logarithm in practice (trial vs. BSGS)

More labs will be added over time, each lab includes its own README and runnable tests.
